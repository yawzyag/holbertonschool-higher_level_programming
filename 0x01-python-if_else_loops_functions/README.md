## what is Python?
see [Python](https://www.python.org/)


> Interpreted high-level object-oriented dynamically-typed scripting language.
> Python interpreter reads one line of code at a time, interprets it into low level machine language (byte code) and then executes it.
> As a result, run time errors are usually encountered.

## Python - if/else, loops, functions
Decision making is required when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied.

The if…elif…else statement is used in Python for decision making.

Python if Statement Syntax
``` 
if test expression:
    statement(s)
```

Here, the program evaluates the test expression and will execute statement(s) only if the text expression is True.

If the text expression is False, the statement(s) is not executed.

In Python, the body of the if statement is indicated by the indentation. Body starts with an indentation and the first unindented line marks the end.
Python interprets non-zero values as True. None and 0 are interpreted as False.

## Python functions

A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.

As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.
