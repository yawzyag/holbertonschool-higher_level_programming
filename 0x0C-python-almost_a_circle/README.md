> Python is a general-purpose, versatile and popular programming language. It’s great as a first language because it is concise and easy to read, and it is also a good language to have in any programmer’s stack as it can be used for everything from web development to software development and scientific applications.

### PYTHON IN THE REAL WORLD

Python is shaping the world as we know it, with applications spanning web development, data science and analysis, game development, and more — even NASA contractors leverage its data management capabilities for shuttle missions. Here are just a few examples of modern Python-powered innovations.

Python is prevalent in the artificial intelligence community for its ease of use and flexibility. For example, a business could build a basic chatbot that answers common customer questions. Programmers could use Python to scrape the contents of email exchanges, identify common themes with visualizations, and build a predictive model to supply the chatbot with responses.

Python is used to run various parts of some of today’s most popular websites, including Instagram, Spotify, and YouTube. In fact, the visual bookmarking platform Pinterest has used Python in some form since it was founded. Python code has also powered the file-storage platform Dropbox’s desktop applications and server infrastructure for more than a decade.

Remember that summer blockbuster with the huge explosions? Companies like Lucasfilm’s Industrial Light & Magic use Python to help program the special visual effects we see on the big screen. It has enabled them to develop standard toolkits they can reuse across productions, while still retaining the flexibility to build custom effects in less time than ever before.
