## Why Python?
Python is the most popular language due to the fact that it’s easier to code and understand it.

Python is object oriented programming language and can be used to write functional code too.

It is a suitable language that bridges the gaps between business and developers.

Subsequently, it takes less time to bring a Python program to market compared to other languages such as C#/Java.

Additionally, there are a large number of python machine learning and analytical packages.

A large number of communities and books are available to support Python developers.

Nearly all type of applications, ranging from forecasting analytical to UI, can be implemented in Python.
