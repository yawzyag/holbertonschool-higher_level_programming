## what is Python?
see [Python](https://www.python.org/)


> Interpreted high-level object-oriented dynamically-typed scripting language.
> Python interpreter reads one line of code at a time, interprets it into low level machine language (byte code) and then executes it.
> As a result, run time errors are usually encountered.

## Python - Modules
A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference.

Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.

``` 
def print_func( par ):
   print "Hello : ", par
   return
```

```
import module1[, module2[,... moduleN]
```

## import Statement

You can use any Python source file as a module by executing an import statement in some other Python source file.

When the interpreter encounters an import statement, it imports the module if the module is present in the search path. A search path is a list of directories that the interpreter searches before importing a module.
