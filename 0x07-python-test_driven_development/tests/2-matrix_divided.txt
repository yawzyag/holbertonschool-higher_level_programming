 How to Use doctest_in_help.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``my_function()``.

Numbers
=======

``my_function()`` returns the product of its arguments.  For numbers,
that value is equivalent to using the ``*`` operator.

::

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

It also works with floating-point values.

::

    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, -3)
    [[-0.33, -0.67, -1.0], [-1.33, -1.67, -2.0]]


Non-Numbers
===========

Because ``*`` is also defined on data types other than numbers,
``my_function()`` works just as well if one of the arguments is a
string, a list, or a tuple.

::

    >>> matrix = [[1,2,3],["a",1,1]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats


    >>> matrix = [[1,2,3],[1,1,1,1]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

    >>> matrix = [[1,2,3],[1,1,1]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

    >>> matrix = [[],[]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[], []]
